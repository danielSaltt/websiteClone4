		<h1>About this website</h1>
<p>The website was built with the intention to test the Acunetix Web Vulnerability
Scanner. For this reason this website have <b>lot of bugs</b> to demonstrate
the forementioned software's capabilities to find those bugs.</p>
<p><b>Please DO NOT use this website as a forum site. DO NOT post any sensitive
information on this site. This includes e-mail addresses or real names.</b></p>
<h1>About Acunetix</h1>
<P><B>Combating the web vulnerability threat<BR>
	</B>Securing a company's web applications is today's most overlooked aspect of 
	securing the enterprise. Web application hacking is on the rise with as many as 
	75% of cyber attacks done at web application level or via the web. Most 
	corporations have secured their data at the network level, but have overlooked 
	the crucial step of checking whether their web applications are vulnerable to 
	attack. Web applications, which often have a direct line into the company's 
	most valuable data assets, are online 24/7, completely unprotected by a 
	firewall and therefore easy prey for attackers.</P>
<P>Acunetix was founded with this threat in mind. We realised the only way to 
	combat web site hacking was to develop an automated tool that could help 
	companies scan their web applications for vulnerabilities. In July 2005, 
	Acunetix Web Vulnerability Scanner was released - a tool that crawls the 
	website for vulnerabilities to SQL injection, cross site scripting and other 
	web attacks before hackers do.</P>
<P>The Acunetix development team consists of highly experienced security developers 
	who have each spent years developing network security scanning software prior 
	to starting development on Acunetix WVS. The management team is backed by years 
	of experience marketing and selling security software.</P>
<P>Acunetix is a privately held company with its <A href="http://www.acunetix.com/company/contact.htm">
		offices</A> in Malta, US and the UK.<BR>
